# Work Day Scheduler

## Description
This app was created to assist users in organizing their time based on working hours from 9am-5pm. This planner allows users to select a time slot for that day and enter what they plan to do. Those plans are then saved to local storage once they click the blue save button. If users refresh the page, their input will remain, unless they choose to delete it.  Color coordination assists with organization where red means we are in present time, green means the future, and grey indicates a date that has already passed.
